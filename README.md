This is a "hello world" Scala project targetting Android.

 - The project was initially generated by `android create`.
 - [imsizon/ant-android-scala](https://github.com/imsizon/ant-android-scala) was incorporated.
 - Changes specific to my filesystem were added.

If you plan to use this skeleton as the basis for a real project, you'll need to change

 - the paths in local.properties
 - the package name and the activity name in AndroidManifest.xml
 - the project name in build.xml
 - the directory tree under src (in order to match the package name)
 - and, of course, you'll want to replace src/com/example/scandroid/helloworld/hello.scala
